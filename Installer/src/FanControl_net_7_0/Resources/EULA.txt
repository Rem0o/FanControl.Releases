EULA and Privacy

1) Responsibility

By using Fan Control, the user holds responsibility for his computer and its components. The user has rights 
and/or ownerships over the maintenance and the integrity of the computer and its components. Any damage or 
overheating issue is the responsibility of the user. 

2) Privacy

Fan Control (the application) does not collect any data in its usage. 
When an update is available, if downloaded through the built-in updater, a single post request will be sent 
through Google Analytics* (GA4) with the version that is downloaded as its payload. This versioning data is 
anonymous, and will not be used to identify any specific user by any first party. By using the built-in updater, 
the user agrees to share the downloaded version number. This web request may be blocked and will not impact the 
update process. The user can manually download any newer version without the built-in updater, if desired.
