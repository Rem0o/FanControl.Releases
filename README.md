## Main features

* Guided __setup__ process on first launch
* Save, edit and load multiple __profiles__
* Change the __theme__ and __color__ to fit your setup
* Multiple temperature __sources__ ( CPU, GPU, motherboard, hard drives... )
* Multiple fan curve __[functions](#fan-curve-types)__, including a custom __[graph](#graph-fan-curve-editor)__
* __Mix__ fan curves or sensor togethers (max, min, average)
* Low resource usage
* Advanced tuning with steps, start %, stop %, response time and hysteresis

## New
* __(NEW) Opt-out of update popup for a specific version__
* Configurable temperature range for graphs
* Decimal support in graphs
* Nickname any temperature sensor from the sensor settings dialog
* Auto fan curve (BETA): Automatically adjust speed to keep target temperature

## Installation

1. [Download the latest archive](/FanControl.zip?raw=true)
2. Extract to the desired installation folder
3. Start FanControl.exe
4. (Optional) -c or --config [json config file] command line arg 

## Plugins

 The plugin system let you inject any type of sensor into FanControl, see [Plugins wiki](https://github.com/Rem0o/FanControl.Releases/wiki/Plugins)

Some examples (notify me if I'm missing some):
* __(NEW)__ https://github.com/iJacks1980/FanControl.CommanderPRO to interface with Corsair commander devices
* __(NEW)__ https://github.com/medevil84/FanControl.AquacomputerHighFlowNext to interface with aquacomputer HighFlowNext 
* https://github.com/Rem0o/FanControl.HWInfo to import HWInfo sensor data
* https://github.com/Rem0o/FanControl.DellPlugin for dell laptops and some towers

## Issues and hardware compatibility

* I am not the main developer for the driver/backend portion of this software. Fan Control is basically a UI on top of existing hardware libraries. Any issue regarding hardware compatibility entirely depends on the following projects. If you can't contribute meaningfully with a branch/PR, don't pollute their issue page with "XXXXX doesn't work". The hardware is needed for testing. If a dev has interest in that project, is browsing it, has your specific hardware AND the knowledge to make it work, that dev won't be looking for your issue, he'll just raise a PR.
  * https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor
  * https://github.com/falahati/NvAPIWrapper
  
* Please only open issues on this repository for the software itself, UI, feature request and so on.
* If you do have a special hardware compatibility request and you can provide a __working__ sample of code that can be used in .NET, like with a [Plugin](https://github.com/Rem0o/FanControl.Releases/wiki/Plugins), then feel free to submit that.

## FAQ
* __Q__: What settings should I set in my BIOS to play along nicely with FanControl?
<br>__A__: You want to avoid any "smart" control from your BIOS. Setting a fixed default speed, like 50%, works great for most people. Also keep an eye if your BIOS has PWM or DC mode on. One could work better for you depending on your setup.
* __Q__: My Nvidia cards has X fans, but only two cards show up, why?
<br>__A__: Your card only has 2 channels, more than 1 fan are plugged to the same channel.
* __Q__: My new AMD card can't be controlled, why?
<br>__A__: Newer AMD cards are not supported. If you can provide a working sample of code that works with these newer cards, please share!
* __Q__: There is no control cards / control cards are missing / control cards are not changing my fan speeds, what's the issue?
<br>__A__: See __[ Issues and hardware compatibility](#issues-and-hardware-compatibility)__.
* __Q__: How does __[FAN CURVE TYPE]__ works and what does its parameters do?
<br>__A__: Click on its card's icon at the top left, a dialog will tell you.
* __Q__: Does it run on my OS?
<br>__A__: If your OS is Windows 10 __Or 11__, yes.

## Fan curve types

* (NEW) Auto: PI controller-ish type function. % will surf until temp is stable at load. 
* Linear : Temperature based linear function
* Graph : Temperature based custom curve
* Target: Temperature based that holds speed until target temperature is reached
* Mix : Use two different curves and apply a mix function (Min, Max, Sum, Average, Subtract)
* Sync : Sync to an existing control
* Flat: Set a fixed %

## Graph fan curve editor

* (NEW) Change the temperature range for finer control over a small range
* Add, remove and drag points arround the graph
* Copy and paste points from a graph to another
* Fine-tune the response with the hysteresis and response time parameters
